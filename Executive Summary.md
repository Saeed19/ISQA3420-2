##Problem Statement<br>
Developers in organizations or companies are frequently using the external source code for better cost efficiency and time efficiency,<br>
but there are many potential risks when developers add external code to their programs. The problem is how to create a system that can help<br>
developers avoid risks while still receive benefits from open source software. One of the main issues is external source code has not yet<br>
been tested license and vulnerability by FOSSOLOGY Scanner and NIST Vulnerability Database. The project manager cannot decide whether the<br>
external code fits organization policy or not.<br>

##Solution<br>
The solution to this problem is to have a process that sends external package to check package license and vulnerability information<br>
FOSSOLOGY Scanner can check packages licenses availability for developers and then store the result to the organization license and vulnerability database.<br>
NIST Vulnerability Database is a perfect place for checking package vulnerability information, so all of the package vulnerability results<br>
can be stored in the organization's license and vulnerability database. The manager can take the package license and vulnerability result<br>
and check with the policy database to determine whether the package is usable in the project situation. Also, the manager has the authority to<br>
edit and create policies to the policy database, so the organization can better manipulate with external packages.<br>
